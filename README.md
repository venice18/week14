## Dataset Description

I chose the **Netflix Shows** dataset. This dataset includes information about various shows available on Netflix, including their title, genre, release year, rating, duration, and more.

## Difficulties Encountered

While importing the dataset into MySQL Workbench, I faced an issue with the file encoding, which caused some special characters to appear incorrectly. To fix this, I had to convert the file to UTF-8 encoding before importing.

## Interesting Observation

One interesting thing I noticed about the dataset is the variety of genres available. There is a significant number of shows categorized under multiple genres, indicating a diverse content library on Netflix.
